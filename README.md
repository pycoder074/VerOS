# VerOS

  VerOS' name is derived from the Latin _verus_, meaning _true_ in English.

## Our Goal:
VerOS aims to create a **fully customisable** operating system that gives people *what they want* and change the tech world for the **better**. If you have an idea or feature you want, make a pull request or email me at **elliott.kelly08@outlook.com**. I’ll implement it as soon as the OS is ready for it!

## Contributions
We want **everyone**, whether techie or non-techie, to be a part of this project. 

- If you can, submit a pull request.
- If not, email me your feature ideas at **elliott.kelly08@outlook.com**, and I’ll add them as soon as possible.
